          >EMDR, trauma informed therapist. I help individuals understand the
          human experience, their human experience, in a powerful holistic way.
          I believe that healing is experienced by understanding ourselves,
          beyond the identities, expectations, and messages we have assumed,
          often unconsciously, that have shaped how we experience ourselves and
          our world. I help individuals relieve suffering and find new ways to
          experience life and have a more fulfilled human experience.</span
